## About
<font size=4>

ACPSC is a project that assesses computational tools for predicting protein stability changes upon missense mutations using a new dataset named S4038. The S4038 dataset comprises 4038 single-point mutations and includes 286 PDB structures, encompassing 287 single-chain structures.

The S4038_sequences.zip file contains individual sequence files for each of the 287 single-chain structures within S4038, while the S4038_structures.zip file contains individual structure files for each of the 287 single-chain structures within S4038.
